# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification using Deep Learning and Streamlit 🌼  

This project is a **Deep Learning model** that classifies Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** using the popular **Iris dataset**. The model is built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.  
 
## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
The goal of this project is to create an intuitive and interactive web application where users can input the flower's features to get real-time predictions of its species. This project showcases:  
- Building and training a **Deep Learning model** using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Deploying the model using **Streamlit** for a seamless web interface.  
- Implementing a **modern UI design** with custom themes and a responsive layout.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Deep Learning model.  
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the model as a web application.  
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.  
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project management.  
- **Ubuntu**: As the development environment.  

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The **Iris dataset** is a classic dataset used in pattern recognition. It consists of 150 samples with 4 features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width
